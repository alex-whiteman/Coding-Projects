This program demonstrates knowledge on different methods of sampling data from a 
population. This is useful for data analysis.

More specifically, this program uses a simple random sample, a stratified sample,
a cluster sample, and finally a systematic sample. 

Simple Random Sample: randomly select from population

Stratified Sample: Divide population into groups (based on some parameter),
then take samples from each group.

Cluster Sample: Divide population into many groups (these groups are not organized in any way),
then take only a select few of these groups for the sample.

Stratified Sample: Use a random starting point for the sampling process, then take every K'th 
value from population.

Upon doing all of these sampling methods, the average is calculated for each and then compared.
All of these sampling methods are also compared to one another by using various sample sizes
(60, 100, and 200). 

Sincerely,
Alex Whiteman
