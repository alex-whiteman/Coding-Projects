To use the Song program, simply type the file name that 
includes the song data (without quotes) "music_list"
when asked. When the program asks for a genre, simply 
type a genre included in the music list (Country, Pop, 
Rap, Rock, Classical), making sure to include capitalization. 
The program will then list every song matching that genre that
is in the file.

Sincerely,
Alex Whiteman
