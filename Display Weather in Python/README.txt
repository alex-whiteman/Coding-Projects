For this program, simply enter the name of any city you wish to find weather
information for. When you wish to exit the program, type "EXIT" into the city name field.

This program uses the openWeather API to find current weather data for the 
requested cities.

Upon recieving weather data from the API, the program then takes the necessary information from 
the JSON file to display weather results.

Sincerely,
Alex Whiteman
