This program can run any program installed on your machine so long as you have the
file path for the executable file. For example, you can run Google Chrome by entering:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe


This program loops infinitely until the user types "exit" into the prompt in all lowercase
letters. 

Sincerely, 
Alex Whiteman
