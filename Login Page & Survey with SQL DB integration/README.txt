You should start this code using the loginPage.php file.
From there, you can use any user/pass combination you like
which can be found in the users table in the user_data database.

Upon submission of a user/pass combination, the values are checked
against the database. Next, a form appears asking for a name and 
favorite color. This data is then exported to the survey_results
table where it is stored.
