The following program takes an input (given by the user) and asks for 
a process number, burst time, and priority. This loops until all processes
are entered by the user. 
Following entering the data, the various CPU schedulers run their respective
programs and output their results.
This program runs via the CPU Scheduler class, with all other classes supplementing
the CPU Scheduler class.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate knowledge of how different CPU
scheduling techiniques function.
