This gas service application was created by: 
Jawad Townsend, Patrick Mills, and Alexander Whiteman.

This is an initial prototype of a gas delivery system application.
This service is designed so users are able to order gasoline to be 
delivered while their car is parked. This system also has interfaces 
for both administrators and fuel truck delivery drivers.

While the prototype is not functional standalone at this stage, I included
it in my repository because it was the first project I have done while using
Agile methodology. My team focused on small sections at a time in time intervals
of two weeks in order to deliver the first prototype.

Sincerely,
Alex Whiteman
