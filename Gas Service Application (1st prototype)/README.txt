This gas service application was created by: 
Jawad Townsend, Patrick Mills, and Alexander Whiteman.

This is an initial prototype of a gas delivery system application.
This service is designed so users are able to order gasoline to be 
delivered while their car is parked. This system also has interfaces 
for both administrators and fuel truck delivery drivers.
