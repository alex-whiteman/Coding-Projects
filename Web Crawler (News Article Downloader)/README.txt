This program takes URLs from the rss feed on TheGuardian.com.
From there, It creates files of each article, with the url, author, publishing date,
and the body of the article. This program also creates what I would consider as "ghost files."
I am unsure as to why these files are being made, but they have no contents inside of them, and 
can be ignored. I opted to make files of every article so that the program is more practical, 
being that the machine can be turned off without losing all the article data.


Thanks, 
Alex Whiteman
